# AI Learns to Play TMNT: Turtles in Time (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
This project trains an AI agent to play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time (SNES) using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The training is performed with Stable-Retro, an integration of Stable-Baselines3 and Gym-Retro, enabling RL models to interact with retro games.

## 🚀 Features
Deep Reinforcement Learning: Using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for training.

Stable-Retro & Gym-Retro: Frameworks for running retro games in an RL environment.

Curriculum Learning: Progressive training strategies to improve AI performance.

99-Life Training Mode: Extended training sessions by modifying the game state.

AI-Powered Video Upscaling: Improved visual clarity using neural network upscaling.

## 📈 Training Progress

The AI improves over time:

✔️ Early Training: Random movements, no strategy.

✔️ Mid Training: Defends against attacks, better movement.

✔️ Advanced Training: Uses strategic dodging, survives longer.

## 📌 Future Improvements
Implement Curriculum Learning for better progression.

Reduce Catastrophic Forgetting to improve long-term learning.

Optimize hyperparameters for faster convergence.
